This software should be run with PHP 7.x

unitTests are run from the command line (CL) and therefore require php7-cli

eg: php unitTests.php

Web interface is run from index.php (requires webserver running php 7.x).

For testing import.csv is created by UnitTests.php and is not cleaned up, it is left
to test via index.php.
